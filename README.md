# Raspberry Pi Storage Discussion

Discuss storage options for use with the Raspberry Pi including SD, NVME SSD, SATA SSD and eMMC.

## Purpose

The initial purpose of this repo is to provide an area where users can discuss SD card brand and usage. I made a comment about this at <https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/21#issuecomment-1752163344> that led to some discussion that is off topic for that thread. There is clearly interest in that subject so I created this repo to host that.

On further thought, I suspect there may also be interest in discussion other storage media including eMMC, NVME and SATA SSDs.

Thank you for your contributions.

## Errata

This is my first experience with Github Discussions so apologies if my management ios a little clumsy. The first thing I checked is if discussions are cloned. It aopears that they are not.
