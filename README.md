# SD-card-discussion

Discuss SD cards particularly WRT their usage with the Raspberry Pi.

The purpose of this repo is to provide an area where users can discuss SD card brand and usage. I made a comment about this at <https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/21#issuecomment-1752163344> that led to some discussion that is off topic for that thread. There is clearly interest in that subject so I created this repo to host that.

On further thought, I suspect there may also be interest in discussion other storage media including eMMC, NVME and SATA SSDs.

Thank you for your contributions.
